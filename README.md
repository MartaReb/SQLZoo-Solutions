# 🐘 SQLZoo Solutions

This repository contains my solutions from practicing SQL on [**SQLZoo.net**](https://sqlzoo.net/).  
The goal of this project is to strengthen my SQL skills through hands-on exercises and query building, using real database examples.

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice writing efficient SQL queries  
- Understand database structures and relationships  
- Learn how to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data  
- Build a reference of SQL examples for future projects
